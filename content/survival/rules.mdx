# Survival Economy Rules

These rules apply **in addition to the Global Minecraft Rules** and are specific to the **Survival Economy** gamemode.

All Global Rules remain in effect unless explicitly stated otherwise below.

## Raiding, Griefing & Claims
1. Griefing or raiding is **not allowed**, except during nation conflicts or wars facilitated through the Lands plugin.
2. Do **not** exploit unclaimed “gap” chunks inside or bordering another player’s or nation’s base. If an area is clearly part of a build or claim, it is protected.
3. Raiding or overtaking **clearly abandoned or unclaimed bases** is allowed. Do not grief the wilderness for the sake of griefing.

## PVP Rules
4. PVP is allowed only in the following situations:
   - During nation conflicts or wars
   - In the wilderness
   - In unclaimed bases
   - In designated PVP zones

## Economy & Progression
5. Do not intentionally break, exploit, or unbalance the survival economy.
6. Lag machines, excessive redstone abuse, or farms designed to harm server performance are prohibited.
7. AFK farms are not allowed.
8. 1x1 towers are not allowed.

## Player Fairness
9. Give new players a fair opportunity to settle and progress. Do not explicitly target, troll, grief, or raid players solely because they are new.

These rules exist to ensure the Survival Economy remains fair, competitive, and enjoyable for all players.
