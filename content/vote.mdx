# Vote for Prosperia

Voting helps Prosperia grow by improving our visibility on public Minecraft server lists. Every vote directly supports the server and unlocks **in-game rewards** as a thank you for your time.

## Why vote?

- Helps new players discover Prosperia
- Supports ongoing development and infrastructure
- Rewards you with in-game perks for participating

You can vote on multiple sites each day. Most voting sites reset every **24 hours**, so make sure to check back regularly.
