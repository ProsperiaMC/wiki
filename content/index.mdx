# Welcome to Prosperia

Welcome to the **Prosperia Community Hub**.

Prosperia is a **semi-vanilla survival Minecraft server** designed to reimagine and enhance the traditional Survival Multiplayer (SMP) experience. Our goal is to create a world that feels familiar at its core, while offering deeper progression, meaningful systems, and long-term replayability.

We focus on:
- Fair and balanced gameplay
- A player-driven economy
- Structured progression without pay-to-win mechanics
- A friendly, community-first environment
- Reliable and approachable staff support

Whether you enjoy the classic survival journey or prefer engaging with advanced systems like nations, wars, and progression mechanics, Prosperia provides a space where **all playstyles can thrive**.

This documentation serves as the **single source of truth** for how the server works, what is allowed, and how our systems are intended to be used. Both players and staff should refer to these pages whenever clarification is needed.
