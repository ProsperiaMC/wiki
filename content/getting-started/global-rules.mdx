# Global Server Rules

These rules apply to **all players across all gamemodes** on the Prosperia Minecraft server, unless explicitly stated otherwise in a gamemode-specific ruleset.

Failure to follow these rules may result in warnings, temporary punishments, or permanent bans depending on severity and history. Ignorance of the rules is not an excuse.

## General Conduct
1. Be respectful to other players and staff. Encourage positive behavior.
2. No hacking, cheating, exploiting, duping, or use of unauthorized clients, mods, or macros.
3. Keep chat clean and civil. Excessive caps, spam, racism, hate speech, or harassment are not allowed.
4. Respect staff members. Staff decisions are final.
5. Do not submit false reports.
6. Do not share personal or sensitive information (your own or others’).
7. Political or NSFW topics are not allowed.
8. No self-promotion, solicitation, or advertising.

## Accounts & Punishments
9. Do not attempt to evade punishments or existing bans. Appeals must be submitted through Discord.
10. Alternate, cracked, or bot accounts are prohibited.

## Economy & Exploits (Global)
11. Do not intentionally abuse bugs, exploits, or unintended mechanics to gain an unfair advantage.
12. Do not attempt to deliberately destabilize or manipulate server-wide systems.

These rules form the **baseline expectations** for all players. Additional rules may apply depending on the gamemode you are playing.
